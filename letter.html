        <p><strong>Dear Customer</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="letter-content">
        <h2>Upcoming changes to how you access your online banking</h2>
        
        <p>We're getting in touch to give you early notice of changes we're making to your online banking experience with us. We're going to move your Easy Access savings accounts over to our new Online Services in the near future.</p>

        <p>We know one or more of the Easy access accounts you hold with us is jointly owned by another individual. We've sent a full copy of this communication to them as well, so you're aware.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Why are we making this change?</div>
        <p>We're moving to new Online Services to allow us to offer the best possible customer experience through new features, products, and functionality. These improvements will help us better meet your needs in today's fast-evolving digital world.</p>

        <div class="section-title">What's changing and when?</div>
        <ul>
            <li>We're aiming to move your Easy Access savings accounts to our new Online Services in a few months' time. We'll confirm the exact date closer to the time.</li>
            <li>At the point we move your accounts to our new Online Services, we'll ask you to complete a quick, easy registration process so you can keep seeing and managing your accounts online. We'll explain how to do this clearly and give you plenty of notice.</li>
            <li>As we move your accounts, we'll also update your terms and conditions, and we'll tell you about some changes to how your savings products will work. The move won't impact interest rates.</li>
            <li>This change will only affect your Easy Access savings accounts for now. You will continue to manage and access any other savings accounts you hold with us exactly as you do now.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-title">Key changes</div>
        <p>Here's a quick look at what the new Online Services will offer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Instant deposits and withdrawals</li>
            <li>Regular, timely alerts and notifications, helping to protect your savings and keep you updated about changes</li>
            <li>Ability to open and manage your accounts digitally</li>
            <li>Real time statements whenever you need them, plus earlier and easier online access to your important documents</li>
            <li>Easily change, update, and manage your account and personal details anytime, without needing to contact us</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-title">What happens next?</div>
        <ul>
            <li>We'll send you further communications as we get closer to the point your Easy Access savings accounts move to our new Online Services.</li>
            <li>The next communication will be in a few weeks' time and will focus on the updates to your account terms and conditions and how your product works, so you can fully understand how the changes will affect you.</li>
            <li>We will also make a dedicated online support page available for you – that will have more details around the upcoming changes, allow you to view and download additional documents if you need to, and answer some of the key questions you may have.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-title">What do you need to do now?</div>
        <p>For now, all we ask is to please check the contact information we hold for you is up to date - including your email address, mobile number, and postal address.</p>

        <p><strong>Our records show we don't currently hold a mobile number for you, so please get in touch to provide this.</strong></p>

        <div class="section-title">Why is this important?</div>
        <p>Making sure we have all your latest contact information will help to ensure you receive any important communications we send you. It will also help you move to our new Online Services smoothly, because we'll ask you to confirm your personal information when you register.</p>

        <div class="section-title">How can you update your contact information?</div>
        <p>You can update your contact details in one of two ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use your online account:</strong> log in to Online Services and send us a secure message with your updated information. Select the 'Create message' option on the 'Messages' drop-down menu on your account's home page.</li>
            <li><strong>Call our Customer Services Team:</strong> give us a call on 0345 122 1122, and we'll be happy to update this information for you.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-title">Need further support or someone to help you?</div>
        <p>If you're finding things difficult or would prefer help from someone you trust, we're here to support you.</p>

        <p>You can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ask us for this information in another format, such as a printed letter, a printed letter in large print, an audio recording or Braille</li>
            <li>Nominate a trusted person, like a family member, carer, or Power of Attorney, to help manage your account or communicate with us on your behalf</li>
            <li>Get free, confidential help from independent organisations that support people through life changes, health issues or care needs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We won't ever judge or question your reasons for asking for help. Any information you share with us will be treated with care and only used to support you in managing your account.</p>

        <div class="contact-info">
            <p>For more information about getting further support, visit our website or call us on 0345 122 1122. We're available Monday – Thursday 08:00 - 19:00, Fridays 08:00 - 18:00, and Saturdays 09:00 - 14:00. We are closed on Sunday and bank holidays.</p>
